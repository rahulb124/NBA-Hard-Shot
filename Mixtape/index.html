Wow never thought i would see the day !!!
<br>
I snapchat that fake shit<br>
I tweet my money longer but I ain’t made it yet<br>
As far as these friends go <br>
They don’t think i’ll make it there<br>
And here and there <br>
I be flowing some of that gray hair<br>
Got cold feet like a polar bear<br>
But you know i finish with big talk of millionaires<br>
<br>
Palace of Versace, sorry palace of versailles <br>
<br>
<br>
Lazer visions from my eyes like snake<br>
When I sign the big deal<br>
No high fives and handshakes<br>
Dont worry these friends are all fake<br>
This is just a big ole facade<br>
Just trying to move forward with these frauds<br>
Got big prayers for all my gods<br>
<br>
<br>
Grab bag<br>
Palace of Versace, sorry palace of versailles <br>
I dont talk about numbers, that makes things too real<br>
